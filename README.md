# eVTOL_MDO

This repository provides the codebase and models accompanying the paper on **co-design and optimization of eVTOL aircraft**.  
It offers a modular framework to evaluate and benchmark electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) concepts across
multiple disciplines, including:

- **Aerodynamics**
- **Mass estimation**
- **Energy and mission performance**
- **Noise modeling**
- **Operations & utilization**
- **Environmental impacts (GWP)**
- **Economic viability (ToC & profit models)**

The framework integrates these sub-models into conceptual optimization routines, allowing systematic exploration of eVTOL designs 
under different primary objectives (e.g., cost, sustainability, or time efficiency).
